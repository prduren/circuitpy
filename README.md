# Multi-Mode MacroPad

Code for multi-mode macropad (specifically in this case for the AdaFruit MacroPad RP2040)

If using the same MacroPad, the files in the macros folder should just be able to be replaced (or even just renamed, and the hotkeys changed) and everything *may* work as expected.

I used this tutorial from Adafruit for the very vast majority of the CircuitPython code:
